After five years in SW engineering I dived into a a Master's program in Computational Science, and it's changed my career direction. I still love to write software, but I'm more interested in SW-based tools than in end products. Specifically I've taken a shine to Operations Research (OR), which provides "advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions."<sup>[[1]](#Cite1)</sup>

I have found that OR has a great synergy with CS, and I'm pleased to have found a thesis topic to help me develop such a SW-based "decision support" tool. Along the way I hope to share what I learn about OR, and progress on as-yet-untitled my thesis, having to do with optimal SW release planning.
