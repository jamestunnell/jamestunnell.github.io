title: About

After five years in SW engineering I dived into a a Master's program in Computational Science. I have a much broader view of Computer Science and Math than before, thanks to a study of algorithms, parallel computing, machine learning, numerical analysis, probability theory, and statistics. I've also discovered several specialized research areas that I think are interesting: network science, complex systems, and operations research. Whether my studies will have any impact on my career direction, I can't say yet. But my research interests have definitely influenced me as I looked for a thesis topic.
