My Spring break started out uneventful, just relaxing with my family. Then I recieved a phone call to set up an face-to-face interview in Oregon. Great. Change of plan. Fate wasn't through yet, though. On my way to the interview, I got another call to set up an interview, this time with Schweitzer Engineering Labs in Pullman, WA.

As part of my interview, they've asked me to make a technical presentation. Well, what a perfect opportunity to put together a presentation for my thesis! So I've done it. It's long (55 slides). [Here it is](https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis/blob/master/doc/presentation.pdf).
