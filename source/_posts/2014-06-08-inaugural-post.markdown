This is the inaugural post! Posts in the future will (probably) be related to whatever I'm working on. Please send me a message if you'd like to discuss anything I've posted (really, please do).

In general, my work is not well-defined right now. I'm still chugging along in Grad school at the moment. But I'm hopeful that I can find practical ways to improve business operations/processes through analysis, modeling, simulation, optimization, etc. You know, all the good tools you might expect from someone well-versed in Operations Research (OR). Well, I'm not one like that, but I am pretty competent in Computer Science, and I'm developing the OR part...
