I built a website! Yes, I know, there are a lot of websites already. But this is one that I built, not that it's special because of that, but it does explain my excitement. 

My client is the Ellensburg Homeschool Co-op, and the website is designed especially to make student registration easy for parents and administrators to deal with. Check it out at [http://www.ellensburghomeschool.com](http://www.ellensburghomeschool.com/).

The site was built using Ruby-on-Rails and Bootstrap, and it utilizes several services to simplify hosting and operation.
* Cloudinary - stores images for account profile pictures
* Mailgun - email service with HTTP API
* Amazon Route 53 - domain registration and DNS
* Heroku - application website hosting

This was a great opportunity to try my hand at web development and help a worthy local cause at the same. It was really a win-win. And of course, who doesn't like building applications with Ruby? It's always great fun.
