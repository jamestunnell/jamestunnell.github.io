I put together some of my old ensemble compositions to make an album, of sorts. The important detail, I think, is that the music is all produced "from source", so it starts as source code and through processing becomes a MIDI file you can listen to. The code for the album is available at my Github repo, [album-ensembles](https://github.com/jamestunnell/album-ensembles), along with instructions for installing necessary software and running build commands.
