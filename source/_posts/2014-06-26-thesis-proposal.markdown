I'm writing up my proposal for the work I'm planning to do on the Next Release Problem (NRP, see <a href="{{'/blog/2014/06/25/next-release-problem' | prepend:site.baseurl}}">my previous post</a>) for my thesis. but here is a rough problem statement:
> For SW release planners to make use of the NRP, they need a process for mapping many raw measurements, taken from a SW project, onto the nicely abstracted space designated by the NRP.
If all goes well, I'll have the proposal ready to present by Fall quarter.
