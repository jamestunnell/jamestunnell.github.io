Instead of pushing ahead to present my proposal, I've spent the last few weeks turning the proposal into a paper (available [here on Github](https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis/blob/master/doc/SEKE-paper.pdf)) for submission to the Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering ([SEKE 2015](http://www.ksi.edu/seke/seke15.html)). This is something that I have never done before, so I'm very grateful that I had Dr. Anvik to co-author the paper with me. The paper would probably fit well into the Measurement and Empirical Software Engineering category. But, whether the paper is accepted or not, I appreciated the chance to experience the process. And we can always improve it and resubmit to another conference.
