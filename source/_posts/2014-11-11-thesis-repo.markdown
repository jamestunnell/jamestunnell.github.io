I put all the files from my thesis work in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository. [Here is the master branch](https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis) at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/jamestunnell/).

<!-- more -->

So as I update scripts, images, docs, etc. I'll commit those changes to the repo and push those commits for all to see.
