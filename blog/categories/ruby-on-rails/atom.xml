    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I built a website! Yes, I know, there are a lot of websites already. But this is one that I built, not that it&rsquo;s special because of that, but it does explain my excitement.</p>

<p>My client is the Ellensburg Homeschool Co-op, and the website is designed especially to make student registration easy for parents and administrators to deal with. Check it out at <a href="http://www.ellensburghomeschool.com/">http://www.ellensburghomeschool.com</a>.</p>

<p>The site was built using Ruby-on-Rails and Bootstrap, and it utilizes several services to simplify hosting and operation.
* Cloudinary &ndash; stores images for account profile pictures
* Mailgun &ndash; email service with HTTP API
* Amazon Route 53 &ndash; domain registration and DNS
* Heroku &ndash; application website hosting</p>

<p>This was a great opportunity to try my hand at web development and help a worthy local cause at the same. It was really a win-win. And of course, who doesn&rsquo;t like building applications with Ruby? It&rsquo;s always great fun.</p>
