    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another project at school this quarter required me to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a> (GA). It was a bit of a fun project, mostly because the GA is a metaheuristic, so its ripe for reuse. In fact, I used the same GA library on three separate problems. The satisfaction of reuse really motivates me to provide improvements to the library.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The code was written in Ruby. There are a few examples included that you can run right away. The README should help get started.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some details might be worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Only a simple GA is implemented. There&rsquo;s not facilities for multiple populations (islands), nor local searching (like memetic, annealing, etc.), nor co-evolution.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s quite easy to use any one of the built-in methods for selection, mutation, and crossover. Methods for mutation and crossover are avaible by just including one of the built-in modules, like <code>UniformMutation</code> or <code>OnepointCrossover</code>. See the examples to get an idea how this is done. The <code>TournamentSelector</code> class will give you an idea of how to implement a selection method.</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s not terribly full-featured, but it&rsquo;s easy to use and it may prove useful for quick prototyping of an optimization problem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished up work on a school project with my classmate Sami, solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) using neural networks (NNs). And not just any NN, but a chaotic NN! What? Yes. And it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The code was written in Python. Go try it out! It&rsquo;s not hard to run, and the README should help you get started.</p>

<h3>The Short Story</h3>

<p>Hopfield neural networks are being souped up for optimization, by inducing transient chaotic dynamics. That&rsquo;s basically all there is. (see the long story for more details).</p>

<h3>The Long Story</h3>

<p>We followed the approach described by Aihara and Chen<sup><a href="#Cite1">[1]</a></sup>. They start with a Hopfield NN (HNN), which is fitting since it was Hopfield and Tank<sup><a href="#Cite2">[2]</a></sup> who first applied NNs to solve combinatorial optimization problems, using the HNN of course. So, we start with a HNN. What&rsquo;s missing? Well, the HNN is typically used because it <i>avoids</i> chaotic dynamics (assuming   weights are symmetric and self-connection weights are 0).</p>

<p>In fact, a HNN is guaranteed to converge to a stable local minimum. Well, that&rsquo;s a good thing, actually, but how will this help us produce chaotic dynamics? Chen and Aihara simply add some self-feedback (non-zero self-connection weight). Now we get attractors, and hence rich chaotic dynamics. Now we&rsquo;ve got a mechanism to get our NN to explore the state space (exploratory) instead of going straight for the nearest local minima (greedy). That&rsquo;s what we wanted, but of course this throws the guaranteed convergence right out the window. Hmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>Not to worry, the simple trick is to decay the self-feedback amplitude, just like the cooling in simulated annealing. In fact, the authors are calling this <i>chaotic simulated annealing</i> (CSA) because there&rsquo;s no stochastic behavior in a chaotic system. So as the chaos-inducing term decays, the convergent behavior begins to dominate and the system will magically converge to a local minimum (which could also be the global minimum).</p>

<h3>The Long Long Story</h3>

<p>If you really want it, here it is, in a <a href="/files/csa_tsp.pdf">brief report</a> that Sami and I authored. Or, you can watch our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ku6XDZD6U9FSL7GWifxkkKqHQyTcFlW7hRSuBttI4Kw/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">presentation</a> on the same topic.</p>
