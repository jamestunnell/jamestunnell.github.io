    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I put together some of my old ensemble compositions to make an album, of sorts. The important detail, I think, is that the music is all produced &ldquo;from source&rdquo;, so it starts as source code and through processing becomes a MIDI file you can listen to. The code for the album is available at my Github repo, <a href="https://github.com/jamestunnell/album-ensembles">album-ensembles</a>, along with instructions for installing necessary software and running build commands.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Spring break started out uneventful, just relaxing with my family. Then I recieved a phone call to set up an face-to-face interview in Oregon. Great. Change of plan. Fate wasn&rsquo;t through yet, though. On my way to the interview, I got another call to set up an interview, this time with Schweitzer Engineering Labs in Pullman, WA.</p>

<p>As part of my interview, they&rsquo;ve asked me to make a technical presentation. Well, what a perfect opportunity to put together a presentation for my thesis! So I&rsquo;ve done it. It&rsquo;s long (55 slides). <a href="https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis/blob/master/doc/presentation.pdf">Here it is</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instead of pushing ahead to present my proposal, I&rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks turning the proposal into a paper (available <a href="https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis/blob/master/doc/SEKE-paper.pdf">here on Github</a>) for submission to the Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (<a href="http://www.ksi.edu/seke/seke15.html">SEKE 2015</a>). This is something that I have never done before, so I&rsquo;m very grateful that I had Dr. Anvik to co-author the paper with me. The paper would probably fit well into the Measurement and Empirical Software Engineering category. But, whether the paper is accepted or not, I appreciated the chance to experience the process. And we can always improve it and resubmit to another conference.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few weeks have been very productive for my thesis work. The main challenge has been leaping the intellectual hurdles in understanding the pertinant aspects of time series modeling, especially the modeling methodology. But, thanks to my newly discovered and very helpful resource on time series, Dr. Kathryn Temple, I have finally been able to talk to someone about the gory technical details. So I now have a solid, working proposal document (see the latest version <a href="https://github.com/jamestunnell/thesis/blob/master/doc/proposal.pdf">here</a>). Now as soon as I can get a committee together, I&rsquo;ll be able to present my proposal and get this show on the road!</p>
