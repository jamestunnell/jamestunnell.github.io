A couple weeks ago I was talking to a campus Career Services rep. He suggested I spend a little time thinking about my personality, so I can reach a more authentic way of operating and presenting myself. Because, he said, employers really do value authenticity so they can know how a potential employee is going to fit into their company. Well, I decided to take him up on that suggestion.

So I finally sat down and took a [Myer-Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) assessment, offered for free [here](http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html). If you're not familiar, there are four parts for the indicator: introvert/extrovert, sensing/intuitive, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving.

The results? Well, they were only a tad inconclusive. I'm sure about two of the parts; definitely I am introvertive and intuitive. As for and thinking/feeling, I probably end up more on the thinking end but sometimes not. And the last part, judging/perceiving, I go back and forth. So, according to the chart below, I'm up in the top-right corner somewhere. Seems about right to me.
